# TicTacToe-game-with-AI
self-contained Python implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha–beta pruning for the computer’s moves. In this example, the human player uses "X" and the computer uses "O". You can run the code directly (for example, from a Python file) and play against the AI.
